Pizza Dough - Long Rest, Food Processor
===========
Ingredients
-----------
16.5 ounces of bread flour (About 3 cups)
0.5 tsp Dry Instant Yeast 
2 tsp Sugar
1 tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil
11 ounces cold water (about 1.3 cups)
1.5 tsp Table Salt


* The bread flour should be a high-protein white.  I use Shepherd's Grain Hi-Gluten from the Inland Northwest, but any brand will do.
* I use Red Star yeast
* The olive oil is a Kirkland brand


Process
-------
I use a Kitchen Aid food processor with a 14 cup bowl and standard blade. 

1. Combine the flour, sugar, and yeast in the bowl and pulse a few times to combine. 
2. Turn on the processor and slowly pour in the water until it is incorporated and the dough forms a ball.
3. Let the dough rest 15 minutes.
4. Sprinkle in the salt and pour in the olive oil.
5. Turn on the processor and mix for 1 minute until the dough looks satin-like or shiny.
6. Remove dough to a board, knead a few times, and form into a ball.
7. Place dough into an oiled bowl, cover, and refrigerate for at least 24 hours.

After the 24 hours, pull the dough out of the fridge and let it warm up for at least 1 hour before you make the pizza. I usually divide the dough into 4 equal parts, but 2, 3, or more will be fine.  

Roll out into a round shape and top with whatever you like. Bake in a hot (500 degree) oven, preferably on a baking stone until golden brown and the cheese is slightly burnt.

Eat, Repeat.
